Udacity Intro to Programming - Pixel art Maker project

The Pixel Art Maker game has been created for the Udacity Introduction to Programming Nanodegree Program JavaScript project. 
The idea behind the project is to gain a understanding of JavaScript and how it is used with HTML and CSS to implement variables, methods and DOM Objects.

How to use the Art Maker:

1: Setup the canvas size using the height and width input select boxes. Type a number of your choice.
2: Click on the color box to select your color choice.
3: Click on any box within the grid to change the boxes color.
4: Just repeat steps two and three until you have completed your design

Enjoy!
